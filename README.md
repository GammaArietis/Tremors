# Tremors
Tremors is MATLAB App with a graphical interface, designed for manipulating and studying seismic catalogs, in particular the estimation of the Magnitude of Completeness (MC). Tremors is a standalone App, i.e. you don’t need a MATLAB license to install and run it.

# Installation of Tremors
In the GitHub repository GammaArietis/Tremors (github.com), there are three versions of the App, one for MATLAB, one for Windows, and one for Linux/macOS. 

# Installation of Tremors on MATLAB
The installation in the case of MATLAB is quite easy, you have just to download the file, and double-click on it or drag it into the command window. Once the installation window opens, MATLAB will ask you if you want to install the App. Give consent and wait. Once the installation is complete, you will be able to see and launch Tremors from the apps menu.
You need to create a work folder and inside the following folders inside to avoid encountering missing folder errors (“catalog”, “grid”, “pictures”, “polygon”, and “station”).

# Installation of Tremors on Windows
The installation in the case of Windows is quite easy, you have just to download the file, and double-click on it. Once opened, Windows will ask you to authorize the App (required administrator permission), please allow this permission to properly install the App.
Once installed, you need to create a work folder, put the desktop shortcut to the app inside it, create the following folders inside to avoid encountering missing folder errors (“catalog”, “grid”, “pictures”, “polygon”, and “station”).
In the installation folder you will find a complete example. If you want to work on this directory just start Tremors inside of this directory with administrator permissions.
MATLAB runtime set the folder in which you start Tremors as the working folder, regardless of whether it is the executable or a link to it. So it is possible to create different work folder and not crowd the folders with data from other analyzes or projects.

# Installation of Tremors on Linux and macOS
In this case, the installation is less straightforward; please use the following link to properly install the App: https://it.mathworks.com/help/compiler/install-deployed-application.html
